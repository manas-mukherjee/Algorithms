- DepthFirstSerach(to visit a vertex v). Stack based
    Mark v as visited.
    Recursively visit all unmarked vertices
        w adjacent to v

- Repeat until the queue is empty: Queue based
      remove vertex v from the queue:
      Add to queue all unmarked vertices adjacent to V and mark them

1.Bipartite - DFS (M)
2.Find a cycle in a graph - DFS (E)
3.Find a gen cycle that uses every edge exactly once - Eulorian tour - DFS (E)
4.Find a cycle that touches each vertex exactly once - Hamilton tour - ( Ref - Travelling salesman ) - Intractable - NP complete
5.Are two graphs identical except for vertex names ? - No one knows
